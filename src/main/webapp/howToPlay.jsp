      <p class="desc2" >Hello and welcome to my humble Guess the Anime Song game. The rules are very simple. An anime song will play and you have to guess from which anime it is. You submit your guess by typing the anime's name on the text box provided. The submit button will flash green if you answer correctly and it will flash red if you answer incorrectly. There are three difficulties, easy, medium, and hard. On the easy difficulty, the song will be played for 20 seconds. You have unlimited time to answer but after the 20 seconds, the song will not play again. You only get one try per song. However, as long as you get it right, you get full points. So, I encourage you to take your time to listen well and guess to the best of your ability. On medium difficulty, you will have 15 seconds. On hard difficulty, the song will play for only 10 seconds. Each round consists of 10 songs, 1 point for each one you get correct. When the 10 songs are over, you will be returned to the main page. You can try once again or choose another difficulty. Keep in mind that the songs will change. More than likely, it will never be the same 10 songs.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p class="desc2" >When typing in your answer, you have to consider a few things. Some titles are in Japanese and others in their English translation. It is either one or the other. Not one series has both the Japanese title and English title listed. Also, the answers are case and space sensitive so you have to type them exactly right. You can see the correct spelling in the Anime Index. At the end of the 10 songs your score will be displayed. As mentioned before, you can keep trying on a certain difficulty until you get that 10/10 score. I know that anime songs can be similar to each other and that there are millions of anime series out there. In an attempt to narrow down your options, I made a full list with all of the anime titles that will be featured in this game. You can find this list under the "Anime Index" tab on the main page. Obviously, not every anime in existence is included in this game. Only those that I have watched and determined that they have a good song(s) made the cut.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p class="desc2" >Good Luck!</p>
